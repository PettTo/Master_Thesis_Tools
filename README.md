Hints: 
    - All Java applications contained in this repository can be directly imported into eclipse
        - The Java applications rely on the FeatureIDE Library. Therefore, the included version of FeatureIDE Library must be added to the Java build path of all Projects
        - We sincerly recomend to use only the libraries included in this repository. We can not ensure the cmpatibility for our tool to other versions of the FeatureIDE Library

    -To execute the tools from command line, read the README.md files from the respective Jar directories
